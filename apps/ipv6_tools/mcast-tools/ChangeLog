	- pim6sd: fixed a compilation failure on netbsd (with gcc-4.1.2)

Sep 20 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd: supports GenID option
	- mfc: sleep a while to prevent a CPU overload.
	- mfc: provides a lower TTL threshold for IPv4 multicast routing to prevent
	       an unexpected multicast routing failure. (*BSD kernel does not generate
	       any error for TTL threshold violation)

Jun 24 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pmsft: build pmsft regardless of the existence of MLDv2-host functionality
	  (if MLDv2-host functionality is not available, only MLDv1-join/leave would
	   work)

Mar 21 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd: supports DR-priority option

Mar 17 2006	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a pim6sd crash when it receives an (*,G) join for SSM-range 
	  prefix (ff3x::/96)

Dec 10 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a compilation failure of yacc/lex files on netbsd

Dec 08 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a bug that pim6sd/pim6dd does not start on non-RFC3542 OS

Oct 23 2005	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd prefers the longest-match entry in static-MRIB search,
	  instead of the first-match one.

Oct 06 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a bug that pim6sd cannot specify static MRIB using link-local
	  nexthop
	- pim6sd skips a hello option 24/65001 with an unknown address family,
	  instead of discarding the whole hello message.

Sep 23 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a availability check failure of RFC3542 on freebsd4
	- moved the location of configuration file from /etc to /usr/local/etc
	- fixed a pim6sd crash when it does not have an upstream router for 
	  the RP address embedded in MLD report message.

Sep 21 2005	suz@kame.net
	- automatically checks the availability of RFC3542 or RFC2292.
	- automatically checks the availability of routing-socket or netlink
	- added a netlink-based routing for pim6sd and pim6dd

Sep 20 2005	suz@kame.net
	- "configure --disable-mldv2" works properly
	- separated the mldv2 configure option into two: host-side mldv2 and router-side mldv2.
	- checks the existence of "struct mld_hdr" in configure script, and define it locally if necessary.
	- checks the existence of "netinet6/pim6.h" and "netinet6/in6_var.h" in configure script

Sep 16 2005	suz@kame.net
	- make mcastread and mcastsend compilable on linux
	- pim6sd supports embedded-RP

Sep 10 2005	suz@kame.net
	- supports OS without length field for sockaddr* (e.g. linux)
	- prefer to using strlcpy() to strncpy() whereever possible.
	- in linux, use linux/mroute6.h instead of netinet6/ip6_mroute.h

Sep 8 2005	suz@kame.net
	- supports autoconf
	- moved mtrace6 from pim6sd/mtrace6 to top-directory

Sep 3 2005	suz@kame.net
	- initial version
