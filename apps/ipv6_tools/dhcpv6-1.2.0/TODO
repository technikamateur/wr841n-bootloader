- Fix RESOLV_CONF_DHCPV6_FILE and RESOLV_CONF_BAK_FILE so they use
  mkstemp() or something a little safer.

- Get rid of direct 'XXXXXX' temp file creation

- Replace all instances of atoi() with strtol() and error checking

- Support a script-based configuration mode, similar to what dhclient does

- dhcp6c can pull an IA_NA and an IA_TA, but doesn't configure the interface
  with that information

- dhcp6c does not honor server preference on responses from servers

- Can hash.c be replaced with a standard system offering?

- Replace all .l files with a single lexer with multiple state paths depending
  on what we're reading.

- Improve config file formats

- Replace both .y files with a single parser with multiple state paths for
  the tokens we're parsing.

- Clean up TRACE() messages, they are all over the place.

- Define all DHCPv6 options and states more clearly.  Fix up server component
  to handle all possible options.

- Add command line switches to the server and client to define an alternate
  config file path, lease database path, and so on (like ISC software)

- Output timestamps using this format: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime

- Port to MacOS X (???)
      - rm: conftest.dSYM is a directory
      - replacement for netlink calls
      - We should not have to pass -D_GNU_SOURCE
      - Would need a libnl workalike

- Support information refresh time option in client and server

- Support lease query in client and server

- Support IA_TA in the server

- Fix the log output

- Do not return NotOnLink for inforeq from client

- Do not trust the client with rapid-commit, if server conf does not have it,
  don't allow it

- dhcp6s does not work multiple relay servers, only one

- Use getopt() in dhcp6r, update usage() screen to match client and server

- Update dhcp6r man page after usage() screen update

- Fix the debug=1 and debug=2 log output

- Support ddns updates in dhcp6c somehow (need to figure out how ddns works)

- valgrind and gcc -Wall checks

- For default locations (/var/run files and stuff), inherit the ./configure
  paths by default.
